//! Clishé is a cli mini-framework in rust.
//!
//! Write your CLI using an idiom focused on the following values:
//!
//!  1. Reduction of boilerplate for repetitive command declaration
//!  2. Command implementation and definition live side-to-side
//!  3. Control-flow skeleton around args, mutable state (context), return type
//!  4. We should be able to generate shells on-demand based on a cli
//!  5. Auto-complete is a first-class citizen, in and out of the inner shell [wip]
//!
//! When I work on my rust ecosystem, I sometimes find it necessary to "try out a
//! piece" by calling some specific endpoint or library API. It should be trivial
//! to create small, re-usable clis for these purposes. This is what clishé aims to
//! achieve by being opinionated and limiting scaffolding.
//!
//! Clishé is a surprisingly thin wrapper around the following technologies:
//!
//!  - `anyhow` for error handling
//!  - `clap` for cli building
//!  - `rustyline`/`shellwords` for shell generation
//!
//! Those libraries contribute most of its power to this framework, which is not
//! much more than a collection of technologies, a thin
//! [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and an opinion.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! This is a simple app with dummy commands to display the spirit of clishe.
//! how to use this framework.
//!
//! ```
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate clap;
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate clishe;
//! use ::clishe::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut ctx = Context("".to_owned());
//!     // The same static methods available to the ::clap::Parser trait are
//!     // available here. If you have a vector of arguments, just use
//!     // `parse_from()`. If you want to capture the parsing errors instead of
//!     // letting clap print them and exit them, you should use `try_parse()`
//!     //                      vvvvv
//!     if let Err(err) = Food::parse().run(&mut ctx) {
//!         // ^^^^^^^^ We ignore the Ok(_) scenario here since Returned is a
//!         // useless unit struct, but this is where we would handle it if the
//!         // returned value was meaningful.
//!         eprint!("error: {}", err);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Could also be called Database, State, ... depending on the domain of your
//! // CLI. This is the single object available in commands aside from
//! // arguments/options. The context has two likely lifetimes:
//! //
//! //  - Created right before, handed to this command and dies with this command
//! //  - Created at the beginning of the shell, passed from one command to another
//! pub struct Context(String);
//!
//! // Could be anything. This turns the cli app into a function(Context, args from
//! // user) = Returned.
//! //
//! // This type offers us two approaches for our CLI apps: procedural and
//! // functional in nature. In the first one, one would apply side-effects inside
//! // of the application tree. On the other hand, one could aggregate functionally
//! // all side-effects to the Returned type and execute them at the scope of the
//! // main.
//! pub struct Returned;
//!
//! // Dispatchers are commands which hold sub-commands. The root of a cli-like
//! // application is often a dispatcher. The application then takes the shape of a
//! // tree of dispatcher nodes, with commands!{} implementations as leaves.
//! dispatchers! {
//!     // Any of the clap attributes you would use on top of the main clap app,
//!     // we will use here on the Food dispatcher, as we have chosen it to be the
//!     // root of our cli application.
//!     #[clap(
//!         name = "clishe",
//!         version = "0.2.0",
//!         about = "Food market",
//!         before_help = "In case you're hungry, here is a",
//!         after_help = "For you",

//!         Veggies: veggies::Veggies,
//!         Meat: meat::Meat,
//!         // The shell command comes with the clishe library. It usually takes a
//!         // dispatcher and starts a shell using the rustyline library in which
//!         // all sub-commands of the dispatcher are available as first-level
//!         // commands. From the point-of-view of the user of the binary, it will
//!         // look something like this:
//!         //
//!         //     $ cargo run --example complete shell
//!         //     > veggies lettuce friend
//!         //     Welcome to the table, friend
//!         //     >
//!         #[clap(alias = "sh", about = "Subcommands of this in a shell")]

//!     // could all be used as the root of an app.
